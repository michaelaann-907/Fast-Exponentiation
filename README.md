# Fast-Exponentiation

The Fast Exponentiation program implements an efficient algorithm for performing modular exponentiation, a fundamental operation in many cryptographic algorithms. This technique leverages the binary representation of the exponent to significantly reduce the number of computations, making it especially useful for cryptographic applications where large numbers are involved.
